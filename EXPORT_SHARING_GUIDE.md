## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find Export
- Check Downloads → MobileInvoiceOCR folder
- Make sure export completed successfully (check toast message)
- Try a different file manager app

### Address Too Long / Contains Email

- Re-process the invoice to get clean addresses
- Address now stops at email/pricing information

### Want to Share Immediately
